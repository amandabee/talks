When WNYC was reporting on teen stop and frisk in ~2012, they wanted to actually talk to some teenagers who had been stopped by the NYPD. They took this map and overlaid it with NYC High School sites and were quickly able to find the schools where they should be talking to students.</aside>

    <aside class="notes">And we end up with this very different map that shows a handful of states -- Alaska, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota with fatality rates of 5 per 100k and up. And the next highest rate, in South Dakota, is under 4. So suddenly we see this story in front of us. Or at least the start of a story. </aside>
