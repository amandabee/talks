## Bio

Amanda Hickman is working on a new project to bring powerful AI and data analysis to investigative reporting. She led BuzzFeed’s Open Lab for Journalism, Technology, and the Arts from its founding in 2015 until the lab wrapped up in 2017 and has taught reporting, data analysis and audience engagement at graduate journalism programs at UC Berkeley, Columbia University and the City University of New York, and was DocumentCloud’s founding program director. Amanda has a long history of collaborating with both reporters and community organizers to design and create the tools they need to be more effective.

## What was the BuzzFeed Open Lab?
How to bring innovation and creative experimentation into your newsroom effectively.

  * Review some of our experiments
  * Our practice:
    + Identify learning goals for each experiment/project;
    + Capture what we learned and publish it
    + Document all of our projects.
  * What worked
    + This was a fantastic experience for the Fellows, we created a real community and had time to really dig in to projects.
  * What was hard
    + We weren't well integrated into the engineering team so they couldn't really collaborate with us
    + We didn't have a way to pivot to projects (or to decide to pivot to projects) when new ideas came up
  * What was better
    + BuzzFeed does still offer fellowships but they're much more tightly integrated into existing teams.
    + We established an emerging technology group that is more dynamic and structured. If you as a reporter or an engineer want to experiment with something like Facebook Messenger bots or ... anything really ... there's a methodology for defining a quick experiment, assessing it, and making a decision about whether or not to operationalize it. And then for dedicating staff time.

It's very chic, in Silicon Valley, to talk about embracing failure and "failing fast".

What I think that really means is that you should be designing experimental projects so that it is quickly clear whether or no

## Current State of Data Journalism
A round up of projects and tools that journalists are using now to do really smart data projects. We'll look at some great data journalism, talk about what makes it work,
