## Back of the Napkin RegEx

NOTES:

I teach data reporting at UC Berkeley and am working on some yet-to-be-unveiled investigative data projects. This is almost entirely a wholesale repeat of a workshop I lead in 2014 -- Regular expressions don't change that much. (If I'm being honest my heart is still at CUNY.) The thing I'm proudest of right now is that I successfully lobbied the Unicode Consortium Emoji Subcommittee to add a safety pin, ball of yarn and spool to your keyboards. They rejected the needle and thread but I'm not a quitter.

[![Regular Expression Cheatsheet](cheatsheet.png)](2018/NICAR/cheatsheet.pdf)



NOTES:

Regular expressions are statements that you make in a pattern matching language.

I can search for all the instances of "regular expressions" and replace them with "regex" without doing anything fancy. But if I want to find all the instances of "Jim" and "Jimmy" and change them to "James", I need something a little more complex.

Two terms you're going to hear: "strings" just means a bunch of characters strung together. Letters are characters, numbers are characters. Curly braces and plus signs are characters.

I even made you a little [cheatsheet](2018/NICAR/cheatsheet.pdf). Once upon a time I had aspirations of actually printing these on napkins but I'm cheap.

### RegEx

[![Regular expressions are a total superpower.](/talks/2014/NICAR/regex/xkcd_regular_expressions.png)](https://xkcd.com/208/)

It will shock you to learn that Wikipedia has an extensive and thorough history of <u>[regular expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)</u>.

NOTES:
Wikipedia has an extensive and thorough history of [regular expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression). It's good.

The first awesome thing about regular expressions is that they're not actually regular. When you start getting fancy you'll start to discover that applications can vary subtly in their implementation.

tip: <http://rubular.com/> and <http://regex101.com/> will make this easier

NOTES:

I like to start with a manageable block of text, one where you can *see* what you're up against just fine.

This is player data from the Washington Nationals 2012 lineup that I stole from [Anthoney DeBarros](http://www.anthonydebarros.com/2012/10/09/excel-extract-text-find-mid-string/) who uses it to demonstrate some cool Excel functions, which will also work if you want to break this all up. I sometimes think it wouldn't kill me to get more current data, but I haven't yet. I did alter it subtly to make our challenge more fun.

We're going to use two tools:

[Rubular](http://rubular.com/) and [RegEx 101](http://regex101.com/) to work through our puzzles today.

Let's say, hypothetically, that I want to put this in a spreadsheet. And I want all the data in columns. I can't just use `text to columns` because there's no delimiter.

So I want us to start by walking through how we can turn that into something closer to...

### What we really want is more like this:

    Sean Burnett, RP, 30, 200, Dunedin, FL, 2350000    
    Tyler Clippard, RP, 27, 200, Lexington, KY, 1650000    
    Ross Detwiler-Smith, SP, 26, 174, St. Louis, MO, 485000    
    Christian Garcia, RP, 27, 215, Miami, FL, N/A
    Gio Gonzalez, SP, 27, 205, Hialeah, FL, 3335000    
    Mike Gonzalez, RP, 34, 215, Robstown, TX, N/A
    Ryan P. Mattheus, RP, 28, 215, Sacramento, CA, 481000    
    Craig Stammen, RP, 28, 200, Coldwater, OH, 485000    
    Drew Storen, RP, 25, 180, Indianapolis, IN, 498750    
    Jordan Q. Zimmermann, SP, 26, 218, Auburndale, WI, 2300000

    NAME: \w*    # Not a bad start.  

<http://rubular.com/r/OCClBeRKQi>



NOTES:

Start with the name. We're going to walk through this together and you should sketch out on a napkin how you think we can solve each piece of the puzzle.

<http://rubular.com/r/OCClBeRKQi>

--v--

    NAME: \w* \w*    # Better, but check out Jordan Q. Zimmerman, Ross Detwiler-Smith

--v--

    NAME: \w*[-\w. ]*\w* # Now we have everyone.

--v--

    NAME: (\w*[-\w. ]*\w*) POS:

NOTES:

But we want to be able to make replacements, so we're going to start grouping the good stuff:    

--v--

    NAME: (\w*[-\w .]*\w*[ ]*) POS: ([A-Z][A-Z])

--v--

    NAME: (\w*[-\w .]*\w*[ ]*) POS: ([A-Z]{2})

--v--

    NAME: (\w*[-\w .]*\w*[ ]*) POS: ([A-Z]{2}) AGE: (\d\d) WT: (\d{3}) BORN: .* SALARY: (\d+|N\/A)

<http://rubular.com/r/lmLv0Igsdo> | <https://regex101.com/r/vS5eT3/1>

NOTES:

Unpack the SALARY "or" statement: \d* will match 0 or more and stop. We want 1 or more. This is why I like Rubular, it shows you your matches. <http://rubular.com/r/lmLv0Igsdo>

But now is a good time to take this over to [Regex101](http://regex101.com/) to see it all colorized http://regex101.com/r/vS5eT3

TODO: Why switch between Regex101 and Rubular?
